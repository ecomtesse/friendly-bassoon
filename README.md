## Introduction

This application was developed as the second project in completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. I was allocated four days to develop a full-stack CRUD application based on the [brief](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir59anz/seir59anz-course-materials/tree/main/express/project) provided.

- javascript
- css (& bootsrap)
- Node.js

## About the App

This app was inspired by a phase I went through in my younger days, collecting and building plastic model car kits. In the almost 2 decades since, they have sat in boxes in my storage/garage because I never built the vast majority and been too lazy to catagloe them, find out their estimated current value and sell them.

Part of the reason I never got around to selling them is that the cataloguing part can be tedious and and using a spreadsheet on your phone is a pain in the a**. Having an app that provides a better user experience might help with this. I also figured that there might be better out there who want something better than a spreadsheet to catague there own collections. 

A more practical future application could also be an app that helps people catalgue their contents/valuables for insurance purposes. The photos in the app would also assist in providing evidence to the insurance company should they need to make a claim.

The current version on the app catalogues my "collection" of plastic models. It allows the user to:
- view an index of all the items
- view the details of each item
- update the details of an item
- create a new item
- delete an item

## Future Updates

A lot! To name a few, potential future updates for the app include:
- Segment collections by username so that each user can have their own myStuff collection
- Sort and filter functions on the index view
- Utilise database relationships
- Allow users to store multiple collections
- Aloow users to insert custom keys and values for their collection
