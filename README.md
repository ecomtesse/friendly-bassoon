## Introduction

This application was developed as the second project in completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. I was allocated four days to develop a full-stack CRUD application based on the [brief](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir59anz/seir59anz-course-materials/tree/main/express/project) provided.

## App Development

The app was developed using:
- javascript
- css (& bootsrap)
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- EJS

The app was deployed using MongoDB Cloud and Heroku.

Balsamiq was used to develop the initial wireframes for the projects. You can view the wireframes [here](https://github.com/ecomtesse/friendly-bassoon/tree/main/Wireframes)

## About the App

This app was inspired by a phase I went through in my younger days, collecting and building plastic model car kits. In the almost 2 decades since, they have sat in boxes in my storage/garage because I never built the vast majority and been too lazy to catagloe them, find out their estimated current value and sell them.

Part of the reason I never got around to selling them is that the cataloguing part can be tedious and and using a spreadsheet on your phone is a pain in the a**. Having an app that provides a better user experience might help with this. I also figured that there might be better out there who want something better than a spreadsheet to catague there own collections. 

A more practical future application could also be an app that helps people catalgue their contents/valuables for insurance purposes. The photos in the app would also assist in providing evidence to the insurance company should they need to make a claim.

In this version of the app I have focused on user experience on mobile (large buttons, text fields etc.), as this is most likely how users would be accessing and using the app. 

The current version on the app catalogues my "collection" of plastic models. It allows the user to:
- view an index of all the items
- view the details of each item
- update the details of an item
- create a new item
- delete an item

## Future Updates

A lot! To name a few, potential future updates for the app include:
- Segment collections by username so that each user can have their own myStuff collection
- Sort and filter functions on the index view
- Utilise database relationships
- Allow users to store multiple collections
- Allow users to insert custom keys and values for their collection
- improve desktop/large screen UX
- share function to allow user to share their collection, or a limited version or it (e.g. with purchase prices or estimated values)
